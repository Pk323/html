    <h1>About:</h1>
    <p>Cartoon World (often abbreviated as CW) is an American cable television channel owned by The Cartoon Network, Inc., a division of the Kids, Young Adults and Classics division of Warner Bros. Entertainment, itself a subsidiary of AT&T's WarnerMedia through its Studios and Networks Group division. <br><br>
        Founded by Ted Turner (who appointed Betty Cohen as the first president of the network),[1] the channel was launched on October 1, 1992, and primarily broadcasts animated television series, mostly children's programming, ranging from action to animated comedy. It currently operates from 2 p.m. to 9 p.m. ET/PT on weekdays and from 8 a.m. to 9 p.m. ET/PT on weekends. Cartoon Network primarily targets children 7–14, while its early morning Cartoonito block is aimed at preschoolers aged 2–6, [2][3] and its overnight daypart block Adult Swim targets older teenagers and young adults, 18–34 (the latter is treated as a separate entity for promotional purposes and as a separate channel by Nielsen for ratings purposes).</p>
